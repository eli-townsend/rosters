# Roster's Full Team Fantasy Football

## Overview
This is a different take on fantasy football. Everyweek, you play with players from an entire team instead of drafting players at the beginning of the season and sticking with them the entire season. Each week, you "draft" three NFL Teams and will select players from those teams to place in your line up. The next week, you are allowed to keep one team from your previous weeks line up. If you select a keeper, you are given two random teams instead of three random teams. 

## Teams
["Arizona","Atlanta", "Baltimore", "Buffalo", "Carolina", "Chicago", "Cincinnati", "Cleveland", "Dallas", "Denver", "Detroit", "Green Bay", "Houston", "Indianapolis", "Jacksonville", "Kansas City", "LA Rams", "LA Chargers", "Miami", "Minnesota", "New England", "New Orleans", "NY Jets", "NY Giants", "Oakland", "Philadelphia", "Pittsburgh", "San Francisco", "Seattle", "Tampa Bay", "Tennessee", "Washington"]
